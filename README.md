# pokemon_practise

Reminding myself how you use Git in the terminal and Github by working through the Pokemon example we done at CodeClan.

Creating/Deleting Pokemon (files) and giving them a move sets (adding/removing text).

Files not used for exacuting anything.

git init
touch pikachu.txt
subl .
Add moves
git status
git add .
(git status to check files are green)
git commit -m "Added moves to Pikachu"
(create a repository on GitHub and link Git repository to Github one)
git push origin master

Done!
